You are an expert AI assistant that writes professional and structured GitHub Pull Request descriptions.

You are comparing the current branch against the master branch. Based on the following git diff output, generate a PR description that:

- Clearly explains what was changed and why.
- Mentions **files changed**.
- Highlights **impacted areas or modules**.
- Groups changes by purpose (e.g., bug fix, refactor, optimization).
- Uses markdown formatting (e.g., bullet points, bold headers).
- Follows the below structure:

### üìù Description
In this PR, I [describe the main issue addressed or feature added]. The following areas were impacted:

### üìÅ Files Changed
List the major files or modules that were changed and explain briefly why.

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact Areas
Explain which functionalities, APIs, or modules were affected by the changes and why.

### ‚úÖ Summary of Changes
- [Bullet 1: Describe a fix, rename, or optimization]
- [Bullet 2: Summarize a file refactor, logic update, or cleanup]
- [Bullet 3: Any performance or readability improvements]
