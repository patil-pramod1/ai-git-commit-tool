# Impact Area Analysis Report

## APIs Affected
- **None**: The changes do not introduce or modify any API endpoints.

## Modules Changed (Backend)
- **binary_search.py**
  - Introduced a new function `binary_search(arr, target)` which implements the binary search algorithm.
  - The function returns the index of the target element if found; otherwise, it returns -1.
  - This module adds a new utility for searching sorted arrays efficiently.

- **linear_search.py**
  - Introduced a new function `linear_search(arr, target)` which implements the linear search algorithm.
  - The function returns the index of the target element if found; otherwise, it returns -1.
  - This module provides a basic searching utility for unsorted arrays.

## Frontend Changes
- **None**: The changes do not include any modifications to frontend components or logic.

## Reasoning
- **binary_search.py**
  - **Functionality**: Adds a highly efficient search method for sorted arrays, which can significantly improve performance in scenarios where large datasets are involved.
  - **Performance**: The binary search operates in O(log n) time complexity, making it preferable over linear searching for sorted arrays. This can lead to faster execution times in applications that rely on searching.
  - **Security**: As a new module, it does not introduce security vulnerabilities directly; however, care should be taken to validate inputs to avoid unexpected behavior.

- **linear_search.py**
  - **Functionality**: Provides a straightforward searching method for arrays that may not be sorted, which is essential for completeness in search functionality.
  - **Performance**: The linear search operates in O(n) time complexity, which is less efficient than binary search but is necessary for unsorted datasets.
  - **Security**: Similar to binary search, this new module does not introduce direct security vulnerabilities, but input validation is necessary to ensure robustness.

This report summarizes the impact of the changes made in the codebase, focusing on the introduction of new search algorithms that enhance the backend functionality without affecting the existing APIs or frontend components.
