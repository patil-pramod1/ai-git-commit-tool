You're an expert code reviewer and software architect.

Given the following `git diff` from a backend project, perform an **Impact Area Analysis Report**. Be highly specific and professional.

Your report should include:
- **APIs Affected**: List impacted endpoints or controller functions (e.g., GET /users, PUT /product/:id).
- **Modules Changed**: Identify modules, services, DTOs, or helper files that were updated.
- **Reasoning**: For each impact, explain how the change could affect functionality, performance, or security.
- **Potential Risks**: Highlight anything that might break or needs careful testing.
- **Suggested Tests**: Recommend test cases that should be added or rerun.

Use clear markdown-style formatting.

Git Diff:
{diff_text}
